//! RWKV-Instant without the desktop's Python.
//!
//! The desktop drives `crate::rwkv::RwkvInference` from
//! `qt/aqt/rwkv_scheduler.py`. Clients that have no Python (AnkiDroid) call
//! `RwkvPrepareOffline` once the collection is open; from then on the
//! collection keeps the model state up to date with the revlog and installs the
//! same transient score maps the desktop installs, at the two places that
//! consume them: before a review queue is built, and before deck counts are
//! computed.
//!
//! Nothing here writes to cards. The one write is to the revlog: an answer to
//! a review card that was already answered today is recorded with the kind the
//! desktop records (`rwkv_offline_same_day_review_kind`). If scoring fails, the
//! installed scores are cleared and the standard scheduler order applies.
//!
//! The model state is also kept in a file next to the collection
//! (`offline_state.rs`): a new start loads it and replays only the reviews
//! that came after it, instead of the whole history.
